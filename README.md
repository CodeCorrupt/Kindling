# Kindling
A (mostly) automated Plex server

## Getting Started
Kindling requires the most recent version of Docker and Docker-Compose to be installed.
Once these requirements are installed simply clone this repo and run `kindling start -c <plex claim>`

For more commands simply run `kindling` to show your other options

## Future
If there is enough interest in this project I'll expand it a bit more to include sensible default configurations, 
as well as running as a service with some install scripts. For now however it works for my needs and will likely stay 
that way until something changes.
